# Database Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to make an analisis on public github repositories. In order to do that, we have a scrapper that gathers information around and by putting the data onto a database, we are gona try to extract patterns, trendings and other interesting data.

## Database

Currently, we are considering the following attributes:
- Coding languages
- Number of issues (open / closed)
- Number of pull-requests
- Number of contributors
- Number of forks
- Stars
- Watching
- Organization behind

### Data gathering

How we gather info? TODO

### Analisis to do
- Does a new replacing language makes repos that uses the old language loss popularity?
- Popularity based on author, orgnaization or language.
- Shifts on special days.
- Most used languages.
- Comparisons of attributes. Ex stars vs forks etc.
- Contributor contributions, speciality etc.
- Repos based on their functionalities.
- Magnitude / size of repositories.
- Amount of bugs vs popularity.

maybe -> dependency of repos of other repos.
